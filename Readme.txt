Problem:
Data Set is of bank. Bank has measured few parameters about their customers and based on these data they want to find that is customer is going to stay with bank or not.
A simple way to build ANN. I have built ANN using keras.

ANN_KFold_CrossValidation.py : Used K-Fold cross validation for evaluating model.
ANN_ParameterTunning_GridSearch.py : Used Grid search for performance tunning.


Data Set: Churn_Modelling.csv

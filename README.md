## Deep_learning_ANN
## Artificial Neural Network code

Data Set: Churn_Modelling.csv

## Problem:
Data Set is of bank. Bank has measured few parameters about their customers and based on these data they want to find that is customer is going to stay with bank or not.

Here I have shown a simple way to build ANN using keras.

## ANN code:
ANN_Code.py

## Evaluation: 
Used K-Fold cross validation for evaluating model.
ANN_KFold_CrossValidation.py

## Performance tunning
ANN_ParameterTunning_GridSearch.py : Used Grid search for performance tunning.
